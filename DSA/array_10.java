/* in java primitives like int char boolean float are store in stack whereas array string(non -primitive means that can be brokeen) stores in heap
* no pointers in java
 * array object are in heap
 * heap objects are not continuius
 * dynamic memory allocation
 *  In Java, arrays are always contiguous in memory â€” they store elements in a single continuous block, even in the heap.
ðŸ”¹ But if it's an array of objects, only the references are contiguous â€” actual object locations may not be.
 internally store 0 by default in array
 internally store null by default in string
 array are mutuable pr strings are immutable
